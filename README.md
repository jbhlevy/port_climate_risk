# Port Climate Risk
Repository for COMP0050 project: Maritime Trade Climate Risk, UCL 2024

To run port_risk, make sure you have installed the needed requirements from the `requirements.txt` file (recommended option is to create a new virtual environment using conda for example). Open a command line tool in the Project folder and simply:

```bash
python port_risk
```
Different options are available which are detailed in the package description.

The documentation is availabe in the docs/build folder compiled using sphinx. If you wish to compile a local version of the documentation please be careful with the path setting which is currently set to my computer because of dependencies issues.

A test file is available to run at the command line for specific testing.
